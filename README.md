## REINFORCE and GNN based Job Scheduling

In this repos I try to re-implement the algorithm Decima, published in SIGCOMM 2019 
(https://web.mit.edu/decima/). The official code its authors provides is written in tensorflow. 
I try to re-implement it with torch.

Also, Decima is applied for stream processing framework, such as Spark. I try to adapt 
this algorithm to batch systems.
